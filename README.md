# Sign-In-Menu
Sign in menu with password confirmation created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

This is a simple sign up form with password confirmation using javascript and jquery. 

A password hint is displayed when event occurs on password input and hidden when password is valid.

A password confirmation hint is displayed when event occurs on confirm password input and until passwords match.

Submit button is disabled until passwords match.

I need to add a function to determine whether there is a username present.
